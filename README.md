# Morse-code-arduino
A program to play morse code using LEDs connected to arduino pins.

Change the first 3 lines of macros definitions *SHORT* and *LONG* to set your pins (Default pins: 13 for SHORT, 8 for LONG)
Then replace the message with "DARCY" at the definition of MESSAGE macro

After connecting the LEDs to the specified pins, you're good to go!
